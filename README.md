# Purpose

Quick and dirty project to extract recipes from Satisfactory's Docs.json (get your own - but you probably
have one if you own the game, and if you have it through steam, the code might even find it), and use it 
to assist with planning factories.

# Requirements

python 3.7ish+, PyQt5 (may switch to pyside because the internet tells me some nonsense about licenses).

If you're new to python, get the newest python version from python.org, install it (make sure to check
add python to path), and then do "pip install PyQt5" on the command line.

Linux or mac may have to deal with multiple python versions. This can be annoying if you're not used to
it, but sometimes just means use "python3" or "pip3" instead of of "python" and "pip."

# Use

Launch with launch_script.py, or `python -m SatisfactoryRecipes` if you really want to.

# Suitability

None for anything ever, I threw this together in a day and a half. If your computer explodes, that's on
you; you can see the source code. (But also, that would kind of surprise me, so please send a video if
it looks cool.)

# License

I have no idea what I'm doing. PyQt5 probably mandates something, so that. Also, if you swipe my code, 
put a note saying "stole some dude's crappy code" or something, heck if I know.
